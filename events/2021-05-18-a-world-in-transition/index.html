  <h1>A world in transition</h1>
  <p>You have heard enough times about data being the new oil, and
do not get us started on "the sexiest job of the 21st century". That being
said, insights from data are already shaping the world. In this very first
Onehot meetup we will explore the role data plays in transitioning towards
tomorrow.</p>
<p>During this meetup we will host two practitioners active in this domain:
one from academics and one from business. Both speakers will give a 30
minute presentation, with some time for questions afterwards. Between the
talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we will have room for
further discussion and socialising.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Balancing water, food and energy demands in fast developing economies</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">A participatory AI-based approach</h4>

    <p>Human-centered AI-based decision support offers exciting
opportunities to understand complex environmental and water
systems that are subject to climate and socio-economic
uncertainty. This requires bridging hydrologic and climate
sciences, artificial intelligence, visual analytics and
participatory policy design to capture the system’s
complexity, to discover the tradeoffs across competing goals
and support stakeholders to make better management decisions.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Managing the energy transition at Alliander</h4>

    <p>The world is moving fast towards more sustainable energy, but
it is difficult for grid operators to keep up! Do they even
know how prepared they are for the transition and can they
mitigate potential failures of the grid while the necessary
infrastructure is not yet finished? In this talk we will look
at some examples of how Alliander, one of the largests grid
operators in the Netherlands, takes on some of the challenges
of the energy transition. We will start by looking at how data
can give better insight into the scope of these
challenges. Afterwards we will look at how a smart grid or a
smart customer can already mitigate a lot of these challenges
without laying a single new cable in the ground.</p>
