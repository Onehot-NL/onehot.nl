  <h1>The workflow show</h1>
  <p>A carpenter has a workshop, a cook has a kitchen, and a data scientist has a
computer. Regardless of profession and environment, however, you still need
the right tools for your practice. In this meetup we will explore some of
the tools that make data science possible.</p>
<p>After all, we need the right packages and pipelines to get the most out of our
data. We'll dive into our toolbox and examine some of the equipment at our
disposal.</p>
<p>During the meetup we will host two practitioners active in this domain. Both
speakers will give a 30 minute presentation, with some time for questions
afterwards. Between the talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we
will have room for further discussion and socialising.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Continuous Machine Learning</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle"></h4>

    <p>In the software engineering world, CI/CD practices have proven to be a
reliable and effective approach to automating recurring tasks, like
running tests, code analysis checks and even delivering final products to
production.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will present how to automate ML processes using GitHub
Actions or GitLab CI/CD and Continuous Machine Learning (CML) library that
will take care of:</p>
<ul>
<li>transferring large datasets to CI runners</li>
<li>managing GPU/CPU resources for computations and</li>
<li>generating ML model report with metrics and plots right in GitHub
    Pull Request so that ML specialists can focus on research.</li>
</ul>
    <p class="keywords small">Keywords: CML, continuous integration, continuous delivery, machine learning, GitHub actions</p>

      </div>
      <div class="small">I’m a machine learning researcher focusing on the empirical study of
deep learning models to improve their reliability in high stakes domains
such as healthcare. At Brown University, I work with my PhD advisor,
<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/">Michael Littman</a>, studying the
inductive bias of overparameterized models. For the past two summers,
 I collaborated with <a href="https://mickypaganini.github.io/">Michela Paganini</a>
 at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/ ">Facebook AI Research</a> on model pruning.
 Prior to starting my PhD, I was an active core maintainer at
 <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a>, which maintains open source
 projects such as the <a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook">Jupyter Notebook</a>.
 I also worked as a Data Scientist, collaborating with colleagues at
 organizations such as McKinsey and DARPA.<br/><br/>


 I believe that the open science movement is important for improving
 transparency and accountability in machine learning. At
 <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Project Jupyter</a> I co-maintained reproducibility
 tools such as <a href="https://mybinder.org/">binder</a> and
 <a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">repo2docker</a>. I also
 am a co-organizer of the <a href="https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/">Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge</a>
 and <a href="https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/">Machine Learning Retrospectives</a>.
