  <p>"It's magic!" Or so they say. Creating beautiful and enchanting visualizations out of nowhere.
The art of data visualization brings us the possibility of identifying patterns, understanding

<p>During this meetup we will host two practitioners active in this domain. Both speakers will give
a 30 minute presentation, with some time for questions afterwards. Between the talks there will
be a brief break, and afterwards we will have room for further discussion and socializing.</p>
<p>And there is more! This time we will actually have a hybrid meetup! This one night, Viqtor Davis
(data company in Utrecht) will be welcoming us in their office located in Utrecht (close to
Leidsche Rijn train station). We will arrange some diner beforehand and then we'll get started
with the first talk at 19:00! Doors are open 18:30.</p>
<p>Since we will only have limited space at the location, sign up quickly (using the Meetup link
provided below). Want to enjoy the talks from home? We will also stream the talks.</p>

  <div class="talk">
    <h3 class="title">The collateral beauty of being a data analyst</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Generating abstract visuals using machine learning</h4>

    <p>Personal projects are a great (and fun!) way to learn. They force you to apply your skills to a new context. For example: what happens when you try to blend a job as data analyst with a personal passion for music? In my talk, I’ll answer that question by taking you through the ongoing development of a personal project. A project that started with a data analysis question and generated some unintended, but beautiful, side-effects.</p>
