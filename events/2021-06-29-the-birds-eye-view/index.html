  <h1>The bird's-eye view</h1>
  <p>We have long moved beyond the point where data existed only in our computers.
Nowadays we live in a constant feedback loop: we generate data when we move
through the world, and the way we move through it is influenced by how those
data are used. In our second Onehot meetup we will take a view from above and
explore topics such as urban data science, geographic information systems,
and spatial analysis.</p>
<p>During this meetup we will host two practitioners active in this domain:
one from academics and one from business. Both speakers will give a 30
minute presentation, with some time for questions afterwards. Between the
talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we will have room for
further discussion and socialising.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Cities need Smart Planners, not Smart Tech</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Inequalities in Access to Urban Infrastructure</h4>

    <p>The appeal of using technology as an answer to all our growing urban
problems has nudged planners to make cities “smarter”, “resilient”, and
“sustainable” for a better, more liveable future. But who are we
improving cities for? Who gets to be served and who is left behind?
Although, policies promoting intelligent services (e.g. mobility,
health and energy) provide opportunities for many, they naturally
galvanise socioeconomic inequalities among the citizenry. In this talk,
we will explore the condition of our cities and evaluate who receives
the benefits of transformations. Building more inclusive cities will
require us to challenge our perspectives on technology. Trivik will
discuss how the members of the Centre for Urban Science &amp; Policy (CUSP)
use spatial data science to tackle problems of urbanization in a way
that is equitable.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Data on Track</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle"></h4>

    <p>Dutch Railways is the principal passenger railway operator in the
Netherlands. They run around 5,000 scheduled trains and serve over 1.3
million passengers a day. These numbers, combined with the high
interconnectivity of the rail network, make timetable disturbances—such
as failing trains or broken overhead lines—a tremendous challenge. The
Customer Support team strives to reduce the impact for passengers in case
of such disturbances and helps them to reach their destination as easily
as possible. In this presentation we discuss the development of a new IT
application for the Customer Support team, and how visualization of data
plays a key role in making the application intuitive and user-friendly</p>
