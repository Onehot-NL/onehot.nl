        bio: |
          As a data science consultant in the energy field I combine
          my interest in data science with sustainability. My main
          interests are in machine learning/deep learning, but I also
          have a solid background in computer science, mainly code
          optimisation.

        The world is moving fast towards more sustainable energy, but
        it is difficult for grid operators to keep up! Do they even
        know how prepared they are for the transition and can they
        mitigate potential failures of the grid while the necessary
        infrastructure is not yet finished? In this talk we will look
        at some examples of how Alliander, one of the largests grid
        operators in the Netherlands, takes on some of the challenges
        of the energy transition. We will start by looking at how data
        can give better insight into the scope of these
        challenges. Afterwards we will look at how a smart grid or a
        smart customer can already mitigate a lot of these challenges
        without laying a single new cable in the ground.
