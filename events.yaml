- title: The bird's-eye view
  type: meetup
  description: |
    We have long moved beyond the point where data was only in your computer.
    Nowadays we live in a constant feedback loop: we generate data when we move
    through the world, and the way we move through it is influenced by how those
    data are used. In our second meetup we will take a view from above and
    explore topics such as urban data science, geographic information systems,
    and spatial analysis. <br/><br/>

    During this meetup we will host two practicioneers active in this domain:
    one from academics and one from business. Both speakers will give a 30
    minute presentation, with some time for questions afterwards. Between the
    talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we will have room for
    further discussion and socialising.

      speaker:
        name: Dr Ir Trivik Verma
        affiliation: TU Delft
        bio: |
          I am an Assistant Professor at the section of Policy Analysis in the
          department of Multi-Actor Systems. Currently, I'm serving as the
          director of the TPM AI lab and head the Centre for Urban Science and
          Policy. My research aims at modelling the dynamics of urban
          infrastructure systems and their interaction with humans in an effort
          to inform policy on sustainable development and planning of cities. I
          am particularly interested in the design and modelling of resilient,
          sustainable and public-oriented infrastructure systems.

- title: A world in transition
  type: meetup
  description: |
    You have heard enough times about data being the new oil, and
    do not get us started on "the sexiest job of the 21st century". That being
    said, insights from data are already shaping the world. In this very first
    Onehot meetup we will explore the role data plays in transitioning towards
    tomorrow. <br/><br/>

      subtitle: Managing the energy transition at Alliander
      speaker:
        name: Bas de Kan
        affiliation: Alliander / Navara
        bio: |
          As a data science consultant in the energy field Bas combines
          his interest in data science with sustainability. His main
          interests are in machine learning/deep learning, but he also
          has a solid background in computer science, mainly code
          optimisation.

        The world is moving fast towards more sustainable energy, but
        it is difficult for grid operators to keep up! Do they even
        know how prepared they are for the transition and can they
        mitigate potential failures of the grid while the necessary
        infrastructure is not yet finished? In this talk we will look
        at some examples of how Alliander, one of the largests grid
        operators in the Netherlands, takes on some of the challenges
        of the energy transition. We will start by looking at how data
        can give better insight into the scope of these
        challenges. Afterwards we will look at how a smart grid or a
        smart customer can already mitigate a lot of these challenges
        without laying a single new cable in the ground.

      subtitle: A participatory AI-based approach
      speaker:
        name: Dr Jazmin Zatarain Salazar
        affiliation: TU Delft
        bio: |
          I am the director of the Hippo Delft Artificial Intelligence lab and
          an Assistant Professor of Policy Analysis at TPM.  My vision is to
          bridge and develop tools AI-based decision tools to guide sustainable
          and diligent policy design driven by social well-being and that
          minimizes existing asymmetries in socio-technical systems.

        Human-centered AI-based decision support offers exciting
        opportunities to understand complex environmental and water
        systems that are subject to climate and socio-economic
        uncertainty. This requires bridging hydrologic and climate
        sciences, artificial intelligence, visual analytics and
        participatory policy design to capture the systemâ€™s
        complexity, to discover the tradeoffs across competing goals
        and support stakeholders to make better management decisions.
