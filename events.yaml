- title: A working title for working tools
  type: meetup
  description: |
    A carpenter has a workshop, a cook has a kitchen, and a data scientist has a
    computer. Regardless of profession and environment, however, you still need
    the right tools for your practice. In this meetup we will explore some of
    the tools that make data science possible.

    After all, we need the right packages and pipelines to get the most out of our
    data. We will dive into our toolbox and examine some of the equipment at our
    disposal.

    During the meetup we will host two practitioners active in this domain. Both
    speakers will give a 30 minute presentation, with some time for questions
    afterwards. Between the talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we
    will have room for further discussion and socialising.

        In the software engineering world, CI/CD practices have proven to be a
        reliable and effective approach to automating recurring tasks, like
        running tests, code analysis checks and even delivering final products to
        production.

        In this talk, we will present how to automate ML processes using GitHub
        Actions or GitLab CI/CD and Continuous Machine Learning (CML) library that
        will take care of:

          - transferring large datasets to CI runners
          - managing GPU/CPU resources for computations and
          - generating ML model report with metrics and plots right in GitHub
            Pull Request so that ML specialists can focus on research.

- title: The bird's-eye view
  type: meetup
  description: |
    We have long moved beyond the point where data existed only in our computers.
    Nowadays we live in a constant feedback loop: we generate data when we move
    through the world, and the way we move through it is influenced by how those
    data are used. In our second Onehot meetup we will take a view from above and
    explore topics such as urban data science, geographic information systems,
    and spatial analysis.

    During this meetup we will host two practitioners active in this domain:
    one from academics and one from business. Both speakers will give a 30
    minute presentation, with some time for questions afterwards. Between the
    talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we will have room for
    further discussion and socialising.

        The appeal of using technology as an answer to all our growing urban
        problems has nudged planners to make cities “smarter”, “resilient”, and
        “sustainable” for a better, more liveable future. But who are we
        improving cities for? Who gets to be served and who is left behind?
        Although, policies promoting intelligent services (e.g. mobility,
        health and energy) provide opportunities for many, they naturally
        galvanise socioeconomic inequalities among the citizenry. In this talk,
        we will explore the condition of our cities and evaluate who receives
        the benefits of transformations. Building more inclusive cities will
        require us to challenge our perspectives on technology. Trivik will
        discuss how the members of the Centre for Urban Science & Policy (CUSP)
        use spatial data science to tackle problems of urbanization in a way
        that is equitable.

        Dutch Railways is the principal passenger railway operator in the
        Netherlands. They run around 5,000 scheduled trains and serve over 1.3
        million passengers a day. These numbers, combined with the high
        interconnectivity of the rail network, make timetable disturbances—such
        as failing trains or broken overhead lines—a tremendous challenge. The
        Customer Support team strives to reduce the impact for passengers in case
        of such disturbances and helps them to reach their destination as easily
        as possible. In this presentation we discuss the development of a new IT
        application for the Customer Support team, and how visualization of data
        plays a key role in making the application intuitive and user-friendly

- title: A world in transition
  type: meetup
  description: |
    You have heard enough times about data being the new oil, and
    do not get us started on "the sexiest job of the 21st century". That being
    said, insights from data are already shaping the world. In this very first
    Onehot meetup we will explore the role data plays in transitioning towards
    tomorrow.

    During this meetup we will host two practitioners active in this domain:
    one from academics and one from business. Both speakers will give a 30
    minute presentation, with some time for questions afterwards. Between the
    talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we will have room for

        The world is moving fast towards more sustainable energy, but
        it is difficult for grid operators to keep up! Do they even
        know how prepared they are for the transition and can they
        mitigate potential failures of the grid while the necessary
        infrastructure is not yet finished? In this talk we will look
        at some examples of how Alliander, one of the largests grid
        operators in the Netherlands, takes on some of the challenges
        of the energy transition. We will start by looking at how data
        can give better insight into the scope of these
        challenges. Afterwards we will look at how a smart grid or a
        smart customer can already mitigate a lot of these challenges
        without laying a single new cable in the ground.

        Human-centered AI-based decision support offers exciting
        opportunities to understand complex environmental and water
        systems that are subject to climate and socio-economic
        uncertainty. This requires bridging hydrologic and climate
        sciences, artificial intelligence, visual analytics and
        participatory policy design to capture the system’s
        complexity, to discover the tradeoffs across competing goals
        and support stakeholders to make better management decisions.
