- title: A world in transition
  type: meetup
  description: |
    You have heard enough times about data being the new oil, and
    do not get us started on "the sexiest job of the 21st century". That being
    said, insights from data are already shaping the world. In this very first
    Onehot meetup we will explore the role data plays in transitioning towards
    tomorrow. <br/><br/>

    During this meetup we will host two practicioneers active in this domain:
    one from academics and one from business. Both speakers will give a 30
    minute presentation, with some time for questions afterwards. Between the
    talks there will be a brief break, and afterwards we will have room for
    further discussion and socialising.

        name: Bas de Kan
        affiliation: Alliander / Navara
        bio: |
          As a data science consultant in the energy field Bas combines
          his interest in data science with sustainability. His main
          interests are in machine learning/deep learning, but he also
          has a solid background in computer science, mainly code
          optimisation.

      abstract: |
        The world is moving fast towards more sustainable energy, but
        it is difficult for grid operators to keep up! Do they even
        know how prepared they are for the transition and can they
        mitigate potential failures of the grid while the necessary
        infrastructure is not yet finished? In this talk we will look
        at some examples of how Alliander, one of the largests grid
        operators in the Netherlands, takes on some of the challenges
        of the energy transition. We will start by looking at how data
        can give better insight into the scope of these
        challenges. Afterwards we will look at how a smart grid or a
        smart customer can already mitigate a lot of these challenges
        without laying a single new cable in the ground.
