<h1>Bringing together people in data</h1>
<p>We're a community of people who enjoy working with
data. We want to bring people from our field together in order to
share our experiences and learn from one another. Whether you're a
data scientist, analyst, engineer, or enthusiast; please feel welcome
to join us!</p>

<p>Right now we're in the process of organising a series
of meetups around data-related topics. One day we hope to organise
conferences as well! Join our events to meet like-minded folks to
learn more about our field.</p>
