<h1>About</h1>
<p>Onehot is a community for people passionate about data science.
We are centered in Utrecht, the Netherlands.</p>

<p>We want to build an inclusive community where everyone is
  welcome to share and learn. Whether you are a practicioner or student, analyst

  dream is to organise a full-fledged conference one day.
